This is a Python implementation of the Counterfactual Regret Minimization algorithm to find the Nash Equilibrium for the simple game of Kuhn poker. This is meant to be a a supplement to Professor Bryce's excellent explanation of the CFR algorithm (linked below). Please watch his video (or the entire playlist if you're new to game theory) before watching this. Feel free to steal the code I've linked below as well :)
